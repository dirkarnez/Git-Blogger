# Git-Blogger
A cross-platform desktop blogging application based on Electron and React.js. I am developing this for using it with my personal [blog](http://sayakbiswas.github.io) which is based on Sergio Kopplin's Indigo theme. Ideally this could be adapted to other Github Pages hosted blogs with minor changes.
